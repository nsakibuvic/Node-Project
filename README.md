## Running the application

After you've cloned your branch locally, you need to run it. We use Yarn as our package manager of choice. We've setup some scripts to get you started:

```
# install dependencies
yarn

# run the index.ts file
yarn output

# run all tests
yarn test

# run jest in watch mode
yarn test:watch
```
